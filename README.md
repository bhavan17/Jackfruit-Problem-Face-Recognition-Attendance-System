# Jackfruit-Problem-Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
This Python script uses OpenCV and face recognition to automatically track attendance. It reads known faces from the file system, uses the webcam to identify people in real-time, and then logs the name, time, and status (Present/Late) into a daily CSV file. All operations are displayed live within a Tkinter GUI.
